1. Flood fill the map and build a graph showing keys and doors.
  -- Nodes have all keys available at that point
  -- lines are the doors that separate areas

  -- Flood fill by flooding the first compartment (no door breakage) to build node 1
  -- Then iterate on all doors found to build the first children.  Then iterate....
    
2. Make another graph with weights between the nodes that are available (redo this every time a door goes away)
  - note if the destination point you are searching is above/below left/right use that to guide you in the middle
